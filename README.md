Added alt tags to describe the three pictures in the content section for individuals utilizing screen readers. 

Added an aside semantic tag to the benefits section then split the three sections with section semantic tags. Added blank alt tags so screen readers can ignore the image content of each section in lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management.
